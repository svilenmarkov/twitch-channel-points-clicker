# Twitch channel points auto clicker bookmarklet

## What?

Twitch.tv has this annoying "mechanic" where you have to keep an eye on the chat for a treasure icon to appear which you have to click on to get extra channel points. This bookmarklet automatically clicks that icon every 10 seconds. 

## What is a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is just a browser bookmark that contains javascript code which gets executed on the page whenever you click on it. I didn't want to have random extensions installed for this simple purpose which is why I made it work this way. 

## Installation
1. Create a new bookmark
2. Name it whatever you want
3. For the Location/URL paste the code from the [ auto-clicker.js file](auto-clicker.js)
4. Whenever you want the bonus points to start automatically getting claimed just click **once** on the bookmark you created.

**You will have to click on the bookmark every time you close the browser/refresh the page/go to a different channel.**
